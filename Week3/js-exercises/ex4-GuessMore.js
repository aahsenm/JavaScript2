/**

** Exercise 4: Guess more **

Look at the bellow code snippet.
Can you guess the output? 
Write out your reasoning in 50 words or less.

*/

const x = 9;

function f1(val) {
  val = val + 1;
  return val;
}
f1(x);
console.log(x);

// The output will be 9 because it is in the global scope and x is 9.

const y = {
  x: 9
};

function f2(val) {
  val.x = val.x + 1;
  return val;
}
f2(y);
console.log(y);

// In this function, object is taken as a parameter. And the value of x will be 10 because it was modify inside the function.
